# Python Basics â€” Learning Notes

This repository is a personal record of my Python learning journey. It contains short notes, example scripts, exercises, and small projects that I've worked through while learning Python. The goal is twofold:

- Serve as a study log for me to track progress and revisit concepts.
- Provide helpful, easy-to-follow examples and notes so others can learn from my experiments.

## What you'll find here

- Concise notes and explanations of core Python concepts (data types, control flow, functions, modules).
- Small example scripts demonstrating each topic.
- Simple exercises and solutions to practice concepts.
- A growing collection of tiny projects and experiments.

## How to use this repo

1. Browse the folders to find topics you're interested in (for example, `01_DataTypes`).
2. Open the example scripts to read the code and run them locally.
3. Try the exercises yourself before checking the solutions.

To run an example locally, make sure you have Python installed (3.8+ recommended). Then run:

    python path\to\script.py
